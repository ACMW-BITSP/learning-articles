# Tools for developers

Here is a list of some topics/tools which I have frequently encountered in software development. I have also included resources for learning them. These appear roughly in decreasing order of importance in my opinion. They are easy and you can learn them in a short time. I have also rated them on the basis of difficulty. This rating is relative, so even a 5-star rating is not very hard. Time to learn a topic is roughly proportional to difficulty. It's okay to be [lazy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation) and learn them only when you need to.

## HTML

HTML is used to write web pages. It is a very common text-based format for creating rich text.

To be a frontend or backend developer, you must know HTML. CSS is optional unless you are a frontend developer.
