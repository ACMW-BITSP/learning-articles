# Starting out with Competitive Programming

(This guide is meant for beginners.
If you have solved 100+ problems and are looking for guidance on
how to solve problems involving algorithms and data structures,
this document is not for you.)

Competitive Programming is an interesting activity which mixes problem solving with programming.
It is not only enjoyable but also very demanded in placements.
Competitive programming will make you very good at writing efficient programs quickly.
If you get really serious with competitive programming, it will make you an expert in data structures and algorithms.

I recommend all Computer Science students to at least try it out.

So how to get started?

## Learn a programming language

Any programming language will do.
But most problems are set with C/C++ and Java programmers in mind, so knowing any one of them will be really helpful.

You don't need to know really advanced concepts, like classes or generics/templates.
You should just know if/else, loops, arrays, functions and have some familiarity with the standard library, like math functions, string/array operations and input/output.
For C, `<string.h>`, `<stdio.h>`, `<math.h>`, `<stdlib.h>` will generally be sufficient to start.

If you know only C, you can easily start.
But at some point of time (especially when you reach advanced stages), you'll need features which most languages have but C does not.
Learning C++ is very easy if you know C. I'll suggest that you start out with C and learn C++ in parallel with competitive programming.

Even if you are not confident of your skills in a programming language, you can (and should) still start.
Competitive programming is also a good way to practice a new language you have learned.

## Start solving problems

You'll find problems on many websites.

Most websites will give you a specification and ask you to write a program implementing that.
You will then have to submit your code.
Your program will be automatically compiled and run and you'll be told whether it ran correctly or not.
Such websites are known as online judges.

You will find many online judges on the internet.
Here is a small list of the most popular ones:

* [CodeChef](http://www.codechef.com/)
* [SPOJ](http://www.spoj.com/)
* [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/)
* [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains)
* [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

Apart from that, there is also a website called [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives).
Project Euler does not ask you to submit code. It has direct problems.
For example, their [problems 7](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7) asks you to find the 10001<sup>th</sup> prime and submit the answer.
You'll need to write code to find this out (since you can't solve this by hand).
But once you have written the code, you just need to run it, find out the answer, and submit the answer (not the code).

Sometimes it takes time to get used to online judges and Project Euler can help you easily start.
But I recommend that if you choose to solve problems on Project Euler, do it only when starting out.
It has advanced problems as well, but I think solving problems on online judges will help you learn faster and is a better use of your time.

You should stick to just one (or maybe two) online judges when you start out.

For beginners, I recommend Codechef. Codechef has problems categorized by difficulty levels.
For each difficulty level, easier problems generally have more submissions.
So you can sort problems based on number of submissions to find the easiest ones.

If you have never before solved a problems on an online judge, you should begin by solving
the easiest problem on Codechef - [Life, the Universe, and Everything](https://www.codechef.com/problems/TEST).
You will have to read the [Input/Output tutorial](http://blog.codechef.com/2009/02/24/54/) to solve the problem.
If you face problems, you can refer to [my solutions](https://www.codechef.com/status/TEST,sharmaeklavya2).
I have submitted code in many languages, so you'll most likely find a solution in the language of your choice.

## Contests

Once you solve 15 to 20 problems, you should occasionally take part in programming contests.
Many websites host contests regularly.

Codechef has 3 monthly contests - Long challenge, Cookoff and LunchTime.
Long Challenge has 10 questions to be solved in 10 days.
You should try to solve as many questions as you can (without taking hints from others).
Cookoff has 5 questions to be solved in 2.5 hours.
Regularly taking part in Cookoff and trying to perform better in it will increase your speed.
I have never taken part in lunch time so I don't know much about it but it is probably similar to Cookoff.

You should not be disheartened if you are able to solve only one or two questions. This is natural when starting out. As you get better, you'll be able to solve more and more. If you are not able to solve any question, you should contact someone senior and he/she will help you.

When you have solved more than 50 to 75 problems, you should also start solving problems on Codeforces and taking part in Codeforces' contests.
This is the site where the most serious programmers of the world can be found.

## Practice makes perfect

Remember that it is very important to practice.
Try to solve at least one question everyday.
With regular practice, you should become pretty good.
One of my friends solved average 4 questions per day for a year and he recently got AIR 7 in a Codechef Long challenge!

It is helpful if you stay in touch with people who do competitive programming regularly.
This will keep you motivated.
